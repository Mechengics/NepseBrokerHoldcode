# NepseBrokerHoldcode
This series of code is designed to know and visualize the shares bought and sold by different brokers over the period of time in Nepal Share Market
First Run the pricehistory.py and edit the names of companies inside the code.
Pricehistory is saved in a csv file format in the same directory as your python script, try to make a folder and run these codes.
Run the DataCollector.py, specify the csv file that you have saved inside the code
Finally You will get the big csv file.
Then try three working methods on the csv file.
1. The first is associated with calculating total hold of shares by each broker.
2. The second is associated with visulaizing the buy and sell by the specified broker.
3. The third is associated with visualizing the price of buy and sell by the specified broker.
Sometimes your computer cannot handle large processing try to break the process in compartments.
Updates will be comming soon where I will make this code in background.
Thank You all.
